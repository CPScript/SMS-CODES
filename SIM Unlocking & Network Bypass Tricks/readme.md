> ## If your phone is carrier-locked, you can bypass SIM restrictions by manipulating network settings. Hereâ€™s how:

**Steps for Manual Unlock (Samsung, Pixel, etc.):**
1. Dial:
```*#7465625#```
* This reveals the phone's SIM lock status.
---

2. Hidden Network Unlock Menu (Samsung):
```Dial: *#2263#```
* Navigate to Service Mode > Network Lock > Perso SHA256 Info.
* Tap [Back] and select NW Lock NV Data INITIALLIZ.
---

3. Using an MSL Code (Sprint/US Carriers):
* Some phones require an MSL unlock code from your carrier.
* You can brute-force this or pull it from carrier databases.
